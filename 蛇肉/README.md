# SNAKE-MEAT

In near future Hong Kong, you watch a young man who'd lost his way bleed to death in a cold, wet street. Upon hearing his desire to restart, you suddenly find yourself at the beginning of his life; and it's your job to navigate the events that brought him to gang life and evade them the best you can.

That was Muramasa. 

At the time, he'd been taking care of me for the past 3 weeks.

I met him after I kept sneaking out of the foster home I got admitted to. Put me into all sorts of trouble.
